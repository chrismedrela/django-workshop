Django Workshop
***************

Django Workshop is a free `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_
tutorial. The latest stable release is hosted at
http://www.django-workshop.de/.

The goal of the tutorial is to help beginners to learn the basics of the
Python Web Application Framework Django. It can also help people with
basic Django experience to improve their skills.

The workshop has been created as material for Django trainings but can
also be used for self-study.

Currently there is only a German version available. An English
translation is in progress.

Creating a Virtual Machine using Vagrant
========================================

The repository contains a configuration for a Virtual Machine. This
configuration will install all necessary software during setup. It's a
`Debian 8.2 <https://www.debian.org/releases/jessie/>`_ system. The
following packages will be installed using `Salt
<http://www.saltstack.com/community/>`_:

* cURL
* Git
* nano
* npm
* PostgreSQL
* SQLite
* tree
* Vim
* wkhtmltopdf

.. note::

    Username, password and database name for PostgreSQL are ``django``.

To setup the Virtual Machine you have to `install Vagrant
<http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/index.html>`_ at first. Then
simply start the Virtual Machine using::

    $ vagrant up

Now you can connect to the Virtual Machine using Vagrant`s ``ssh`` command::

    $ vagrant ssh
