********************
A new Django Project
********************

.. index:: Project structure, startproject

Start the Django Project
========================

You can create a new Django project with the following command::

    $ django-admin.py startproject cookbook

After you've run the command you'll find the following structure::

    cookbook
    |-- cookbook
    |   |-- __init__.py
    |   |-- asgi.py
    |   |-- settings.py
    |   |-- urls.py
    |   `-- wsgi.py
    `-- manage.py

.. index:: Development server, runserver

Test the Development Server
===========================

After you've created the project, you can change to the directory
:file:`cookbook`::

    $ cd cookbook

And try out the development server with the following command:

::

    $ python manage.py runserver
    Watching for file changes with StatReloader
    Performing system checks...

    System check identified no issues (0 silenced).

    You have 17 unapplied migration(s). Your project may not work properly until you apply the migrations for app(s): admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions.
    Run 'python manage.py migrate' to apply them.

    July 23, 2020 - 10:57:18
    Django version 3.0.8, using settings 'cookbook.settings'
    Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
    Quit the server with CONTROL-C.

Now you can open the "Welcome to Django" site from
http://127.0.0.1:8000/.  After you've opened the site, you can kill the
development server with :kbd:`CTRL + C`.

.. index:: Configuration

Configuration
=============

In order to work with the project, you need to configure it. To do that,
open the file :file:`settings.py` in a text editor.

So that you don't need to enter the project directory several times in the
configuration, it's saved in a "constant". This constant can then be used
everywhere where the project directory is required. You can find it right at
the top of the :file:`settings.py` file:

.. literalinclude:: ../src/cookbook/cookbook/settings.py
    :lines: 13-16

.. doctest::
    :hide:

    >>> settings.BASE_DIR.endswith('/cookbook')
    True

The first thing that needs to be configured is the path where the templates
will be located. The :file:`settings.py` already contains a ``TEMPLATES``
constant which is preconfigured to use Django's template engine. Add the path
to the templates directory to the ``DIRS`` list:

.. literalinclude:: ../src/cookbook/cookbook/settings.py
    :lines: 55-66, 68-70
    :emphasize-lines: 4

The existing database connection ``default`` is already configured to use
`SQLite <http://www.sqlite.org/>`_, because it's built into Python:

.. literalinclude:: ../src/cookbook/cookbook/settings.py
    :lines: 75-83
    :emphasize-lines: 5-8

.. doctest::
    :hide:

    >>> settings.DATABASES['default']['ENGINE'].endswith('sqlite3')
    True
    >>> settings.DATABASES['default']['NAME'].startswith(settings.BASE_DIR)
    True

Next change the timezone and language to suit:

.. literalinclude:: ../src/cookbook/cookbook/settings.py
    :lines: 86-91

.. doctest::
    :hide:

    >>> settings.TIME_ZONE == 'Europe/Berlin'
    True
    >>> settings.LANGUAGE_CODE == 'en-us'
    True

The constant ``LANGUAGE_CODE`` configures the language of the Admin
inferface which we will use later to English. You can change it to a
different language, e.g. use ``de`` as ``LANGUAGE_CODE`` if you want
to use German.

Lastly, the path to the static files and the location for uploaded files must
be defined:

.. literalinclude:: ../src/cookbook/cookbook/settings.py
    :lines: 105-110

.. doctest::
    :hide:

    >>> settings.STATICFILES_DIRS[0].startswith(settings.BASE_DIR)
    True
    >>> settings.STATICFILES_DIRS[0].endswith('static')
    True
    >>> settings.TEMPLATE_DIRS[0].startswith(settings.BASE_DIR)
    True
    >>> settings.TEMPLATE_DIRS[0].endswith('templates')
    True

Now create the directories for media and static files as well as templates
under the directory :file:`cookbook`::

    $ mkdir media static templates

Afterwards the directory structure should look as follows::

    cookbook
    |-- cookbook
    |   |-- __init__.py
    |   |-- settings.py
    |   |-- urls.py
    |   `-- wsgi.py
    |-- manage.py
    |-- media
    |-- static
    `-- templates
