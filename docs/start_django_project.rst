********************
A new Django Project
********************

.. index:: Project structure, startproject

Start the Django Project
========================

You can create a new Django project with the following command::

    $ django-admin.py startproject cookbook

After you've run the command you'll find the following structure::

    cookbook
    |-- cookbook
    |   |-- __init__.py
    |   |-- settings.py
    |   |-- urls.py
    |   `-- wsgi.py
    `-- manage.py

.. index:: Development server, runserver

Test the Development Server
===========================

After you've created the project, you can change to the directory
:file:`cookbook`::

    $ cd cookbook

And try out the development server with the following command:

.. literalinclude:: runserver-migrationsrequired.log

Now you can open the "Welcome to Django" site from
http://127.0.0.1:8000/.  After you've opened the site, you can kill the
development server with :kbd:`CTRL + C`.

.. index:: Configuration

Configuration
=============

In order to work with the project, you need to configure it. To do that,
open the file :file:`settings.py` in a text editor.

So that you don't need to enter the project directory several times in the
configuration, it's saved in a "constant". This constant can then be used
everywhere where the project directory is required. You can find it right at
the top of the :file:`settings.py` file:

.. literalinclude:: ../src/cookbook/cookbook/settings.py
    :lines: 13-16

.. doctest::
    :hide:

    >>> settings.BASE_DIR.endswith('/cookbook')
    True

The first thing that needs to be configured is the path where the templates
will be located. The :file:`settings.py` already contains a ``TEMPLATES``
constant which is preconfigured to use Django's template engine. Add the path
to the templates directory to the ``DIRS`` list:

.. literalinclude:: ../src/cookbook/cookbook/settings.py
    :lines: 56-67, 69-71
    :emphasize-lines: 4

The existing database connection ``default`` is already configured to use
`SQLite <http://www.sqlite.org/>`_, because it's built into Python:

.. literalinclude:: ../src/cookbook/cookbook/settings.py
    :lines: 76-84
    :emphasize-lines: 5-8

.. doctest::
    :hide:

    >>> settings.DATABASES['default']['ENGINE'].endswith('sqlite3')
    True
    >>> settings.DATABASES['default']['NAME'].startswith(settings.BASE_DIR)
    True

Next change the timezone and language to suit:

.. literalinclude:: ../src/cookbook/cookbook/settings.py
    :lines: 87-92

.. doctest::
    :hide:

    >>> settings.TIME_ZONE == 'Europe/Berlin'
    True
    >>> settings.LANGUAGE_CODE == 'en-us'
    True

The constant ``LANGUAGE_CODE`` configures the language of the Admin
inferface which we will use later to English. You can change it to a
different language, e.g. use ``de`` as ``LANGUAGE_CODE`` if you want
to use German.

Lastly, the path to the static files and the location for uploaded files must
be defined:

.. literalinclude:: ../src/cookbook/cookbook/settings.py
    :lines: 106-111

.. doctest::
    :hide:

    >>> settings.STATICFILES_DIRS[0].startswith(settings.BASE_DIR)
    True
    >>> settings.STATICFILES_DIRS[0].endswith('static')
    True
    >>> settings.TEMPLATE_DIRS[0].startswith(settings.BASE_DIR)
    True
    >>> settings.TEMPLATE_DIRS[0].endswith('templates')
    True

Now create the directories for media and static files as well as templates
under the directory :file:`cookbook`::

    $ mkdir media static templates

Afterwards the directory structure should look as follows::

    cookbook
    |-- cookbook
    |   |-- __init__.py
    |   |-- settings.py
    |   |-- urls.py
    |   `-- wsgi.py
    |-- manage.py
    |-- media
    |-- static
    `-- templates
