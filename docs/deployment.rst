Deployment
**********

Djangoâ€™s primary deployment platform is `WSGI <http://www.wsgi.org/>`_, which
stands for Web Server Gateway Interface. It's a specification that describes
how a web server communicates with web applications, and how web applications
can be chained together to process a single request. WSGI is a Python standard
described in detail in :pep:`3333`.

The :command:`startproject` management command has created a
simple default WSGI configuration for you, which you can direct to any
WSGI-compliant application server to use.

Some of the most popular WSGI servers are:

* `Gunicorn <http://gunicorn.org/>`_ - A Python WSGI HTTP Server for UNIX
* `modwsgi <https://github.com/GrahamDumpleton/mod_wsgi>`_ - A Python WSGI adapter module for Apache
* `uWSGI <http://projects.unbit.it/uwsgi/>`_ - A full stack for building hosting services, including a WSGI plugin

.. We will use the following technologies to deploy our project:

   * `uWSGI <http://projects.unbit.it/uwsgi/>`_
   * `nginx <http://nginx.org/>`_
   * `PostgreSQL <http://postgresql.org/>`_

.. We will use `Vagrant <http://vagrantup.com>`_ and
   `VirtualBox <www.virtualbox.org>`_ to simulate a `Debian <http://debian.org/>`_
   server. All required services will be installed and configured using
   `SaltStack <http://saltstack.com/>`_.
